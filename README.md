# FDIC Failed Banks Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of failed banks in the United States using Power BI. The project explores trends in bank failures and provides insights into their causes and patterns.

## **Project Overview**
The analysis addresses key questions:
- Which U.S. state has the most failed banks?
- What is the monthly breakdown of bank failures?
- How have bank failures trended over the years?

## **Steps Performed**
1. **Data Source**:  
   The raw data was sourced directly from the [FDIC website](https://www.fdic.gov).

2. **Data Transformation**:  
   - Cleaned and reshaped data in Power Query (e.g., removed unnecessary columns, merged columns using M Query).  
   - Created a custom date table using DAX for time-series analysis.  

3. **Data Modeling**:  
   - Linked the Failed Banks table to the Calendar table for analysis.

4. **Visualizations and Insights**:  
   - Trends of bank failures by year.
   - Monthly patterns of failures.
   - Geographic distribution of failed banks.
